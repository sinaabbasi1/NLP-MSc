# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains assignments and solutions from the Natural Language Processing course.

### Assignment 1: minBERT
  - Find details about this assignment [here](https://github.com/sinaabbasi1/minbert-assignment-tnlp).

### Assignment 2: Image Captioning
  - Develop a model to generate captions for images using `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` and `distilgpt2` inspired by [VisionEncoderDecoderModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/vision-encoder-decoder).
  - Evaluated using Rouge, Bleu-1, Bleu-2, Bleu-3, Bleu-4, and BERT-Score metrics.

### Assignment 3: Efficient Fine-tuning
  - Fine-tuning the pre-trained RoBERTa model by implementing and using the adapter technique for the IMDB Movie Review dataset.

### Assignment 4: Explainable AI
  - Implementation of Integrated Gradient to investigate the decision-making process of Transformer-based models.
